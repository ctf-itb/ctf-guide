# Reverse Engineering
Reverse Engineering (RE) problems in CTF are usually designed in such a way which forces the constestants to understand what a program does. The flag of RE problems are usually found when the contestants has found the correct input to the given program. One example of a RE problem might be finding a serial code that is acceptable to the program given.

## Tools
The tools you might need to solve RE problems:
- Debugger ([gdb](http://www.gdbtutorial.com/tutorial/how-install-gdb)) - to RE compiled programs.
- Disassembler ([IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/), [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), etc.) - to RE compiled programs.
- SMT Solver ([z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)) - to solve equations given some constraints.
- etc.
