## WTF is CTF?

CTF (Capture the Flag) is a type of information security competition on which the contestants will be tasked to solve a number of challenges. To solve these challenges, the contestants may have to hack a system, leak certain data, or find a piece of text hidden somewhere in a webpage or a file. All these will give the contestants a flag in form of a text which will be accumulated to points hence the name **Capture the Flag**.

What differs CTF to other competitions is that the contestants are usually **encouraged** to do research on the Internet, be it some common vulnerabilities that other people has documented, or even some [zero-day attacks](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/zero-day-exploit).

There are a few styles of CTF competition, namely Jeopardy, Attack-Defense, and Hack the Box. This guide will cover mostly regarding Jeopardy style CTF, as it is the most common one.

Flags in CTF are usually (but not always) a text of [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) wrapped within `CTFNAME{flag}`, e.g.:
```

This guide and some other [resources](#External-Resources) may help. CTF competitions are regularly posted in [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/). We encourage you to try joining these competitions.
